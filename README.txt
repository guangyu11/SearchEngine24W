  Our program is a memory-friendly search engine with basic ranking algorithms. We use "batch value" to process
  index and use tf-idf scores with important words to ranking pages.

Launch search engine:

  you excute the program, you can wait for a prompt that indicates you to enter a query.

  to the console
